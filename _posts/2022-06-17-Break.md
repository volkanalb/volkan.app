Previous week I've started a new project without thinking if I have time. Actually I don't have any nowadays. We have critical upgrade project at work. But it will finish this month. Also there are lots of things that need to be done at home. Because we are renovating our home. Mostly I'm doing the "amelasyon" stuff :) I'll share photos next week. Take care!
